	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>Becoming a developer appeals to me because it combines creativity, problem-solving, and the opportunity to make a tangible impact. I have always been fascinated by how technology can transform ideas into reality, and as a developer, I can be at the forefront of that transformation. The challenge of writing code to solve complex problems excites me, and the prospect of continuously learning new technologies and methodologies keeps me motivated. Additionally, I want to be part of a field that is constantly evolving, where my contributions can help shape the future and improve the lives of others.</p>
